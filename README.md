"The Daily Grind" - Complete Color Palette
Concept: Earthy, warm, inviting, sophisticated yet rustic.

    These are the most dominant colors, used for large sections, main text, and key branding elements.

    Dark Coffee Brown: #4A3C32

        Usage: Main text, navigation, footers, background elements, outlines. This color grounds the design and evokes the richness of coffee.

    Warm Cream: #F5F2EC

        Usage: Main background color for content areas, cards, sections. Provides a clean, soft canvas.

Secondary Colors (Supporting Elements)
    Used to complement the primary colors and add depth.

        Usage: Secondary backgrounds, dividing lines, borders, hover states for buttons, subtle accents on cards.

    Deep Forest Green: #5D6D5F
